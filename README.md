## Assignment: communication using UDP protocol 

This project involves designing and implementing a Peer-to-Peer (P2P) application that uses a custom protocol built on top of UDP (User Datagram Protocol)in the transport layer of the TCP/IP model. The application allows communication between two participants in a local Ethernet network, enabling both text exchange and arbitrary file transfers. Both nodes in the network will function simultaneously as both the sender and receiver.
