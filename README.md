Assignment: communication using UDP protocol 

To design and implement a P2P(PEER-TO-PEER) application using a custom protocol built 
on top of UDP (User Datagram Protocol) in the transport layer of the TCP/IP network model. 
The application will allow communication between two participants in a local Ethernet network, 
including text exchange and transfer of arbitrary files between computers (nodes).
The two nodes will act simultaneously as receiver and sender.
